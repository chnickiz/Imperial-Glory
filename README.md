This repository contains:
- Source code and file specifications for .V3D, .LVL and .DT files
- WAV to OGG converter

These files were provided shortly after the release of Imperial Glory by Rubén Justo Ibáñez, who was a developer at Pyro Studios.

Please note that a functional importer/ exporter for these filetypes doesn't currently exist. I've placed them here for educational purposes.
